# Medical AI Assistant

This project is an intelligent assistant designed to help with medical data interpretation and early health analysis. It currently includes two main components:

## Features

### Blood Test Analyzer  
Automatically interprets blood test results and provides feedback based on standard medical reference values. It identifies abnormal indicators and highlights possible concerns for further medical attention.

### Symptom Analyzer  
Processes user-provided symptoms and uses a machine learning model to suggest possible related conditions. It is intended to support early screening and direct users toward appropriate medical evaluation.

## Future Plans

In future versions, the system will include a personalized risk calculator for common chronic diseases such as heart attack, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

## How to Use

1. Input your blood test data or list of symptoms.
2. The system processes the input using trained models.
3. You receive an interpretation and possible condition suggestions.
